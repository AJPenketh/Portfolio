            <h3>About Me</h3>
             <p>My name is Anthony, I was born and raised in Manchester and I currently work in finance as a Assistant Financial Controller.</p>
            <p>I have a strong desire to switch things up and change careers as I am not getting a lot of job satisfaction out of my current career path. I have always been good at problem solving which I have found lends itself quite well to working with and creating code. I was introduced to coding in the past by inadvertantly using html to design and create online invoice templates. I have since self-studied by using online resources such as The Odin Project and Codecademy</p>
